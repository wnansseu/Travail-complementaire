## What is this?
This is a very simple timetable app I crafted for my personal use. It works with JSON data stored in the assets folder.

## Can I use it too?
Yes. However, you will have to fork the project, change the data, and rebuild the app. You can either update the [JSON file](https://github.com/xiprox/Timetable/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/timetable.json) directly or create a copy of [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LStBwnFAdI6i9WK33_AZ0QXDIASUvgBCzDIgKDlHl3Q) spreadsheet and then convert the data to JSON (you can use [Mr. Data Converter](https://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter)).
